# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Web Platform Contribution
Guide! In order to improve consistency and avoid uncertainty, we follow a few
stylistic conventions:

- Semantic line feeds - write each sentence on a dedicated line; these line
  breaks won't be visible in the rendered version of the guide; see [Semantic
  Linefeeds](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/) for
  the rationale behind this convention
