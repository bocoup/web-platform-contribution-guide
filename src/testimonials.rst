**1. Tell us about the role you play in web standards work - what, where, and how are you contributing?**

I try to improve interoperability between browser engines,
and at the same time address web developers' pain points and improve accessibility.

I analyze web compatibility by researching HTTP Archive,
identify pain points for web developers,
design solutions,
discuss with implementers to understand their requirements,
write specification prose,
write conformance tests,
review specification changes and tests,
find, report, and sometimes fix bugs in specifications and implementations.

I am one of the editors of the HTML standard,
in particular images, video, form controls, rendering, the HTML parser.

**2. How did you first get into web standards work?**

I first got interested in web design after a class in web design at school, around age 17.
I learned that there were multiple web browsers, but sometimes web sites would only work correctly in one of them.
I quickly ran into differences between browsers.
This was when before Firefox was called Firefox, but I learned that this browser was better than Internet Explorer 6.0 at following the web standards.

This was an interesting space.
So much to explore.
I would read tutorials, blogs, specifications, and discuss front-end web development in forums.
Eventually I learned by helping professional web developers who were asking for advice in these forums.
Following the web standards first and applying hacks and workarounds for IE6 was challenging and fun.

I did a lot of "view source" to find out how things were done.
I would read the HTML (or XHTML) and CSS source code of w3.org.
I recall one day I was viewing the W3C homepage and in the sidebar it was showing a graybeard who was working with W3C specifications,
and I thought to myself "I wonder what it would be like to have this as a job".
A split second later I snapped back to reality and realized that was never going to happen.

I started studying "Innovation and Product Design" at Mälardalens Högskola in Sweden.
I was going to become a product designer -- designing physical products.
Web development was still a strong interest, but it shifted more towards web standards and web browsers.
I read a document by Ian Hickson about `how to minimize a test case <https://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/writing-test-cases-for-web-browsers>`__
and started reporting bugs to browsers.
I was chatting with Anne van Kesteren in ICQ about why CSS didn't have a parent selector.

In 2005, I subscribed to the WHATWG mailing list, and started to participate in discussions about this exciting next version of HTML.
One of my earliest contributions was `suggesting the new doctype <https://annevankesteren.nl/2005/07/html5-doctype>`__.

In 2007, I applied for a summer internship at Opera Software in Linköping, to work on writing tests for HTML5.
I got the job, and after the internship I was offered a full-time position to work on Quality Assurance for the DocXS (Documents, XML, and Scripting) team.
I accepted the offer and dropped off University.

**3. What skills do you rely on most in your work?
Which do you find most important for success?**

Communication is critical.
In my case, this is almost always asynchronous written communication.
This allows me to think things through and do my research before responding to a question.

Being able to read (and write) a specification correctly.

Ability to imagine the behavior of a complex system or an algorithm.

Identifying interesting cases to test.

**4. What advice do would you have given to your younger self when you were starting out?**

Maybe to study Computer Science, which I have not done.
I think it would have been more relevant knowledge for me (e.g., algorithms, data structures), given what I ended up working with.
On the other hand, maybe I would end up on a completely different career path?

I think my advice would be to have the courage to change what to study when I realized what my interests were.

**5. Why do you think web standards work is important?
What's at stake?**

The web, in principle, gives anyone free speech and access to information, without full control of any one entity.

Throughout the lifetime of the web, it has been in competition with other information or application platforms that are often under control of one company.

Without working on web standards, the web would probably have been replaced completely by one or more of those,
enabling censorship and limitation of access to information.
