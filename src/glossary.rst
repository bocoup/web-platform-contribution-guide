    Runtime
        A jargon term for the environment in which code runs, like a browser, or node, etc. The term is derived from the **runtime phase** of a computer's execution of a program.

This term is also used to refer to the details and :term:`API` surface of the environment that the program is running in. For example JavaScript code in an HTML document has access to the `window` object in it's runtime, whereas the same code running in node.js would have acces to the :term:`Node Global`.
