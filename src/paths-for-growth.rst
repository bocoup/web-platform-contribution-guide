Analyze Web Compat Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Web Compat Project is a place to report bugs for websites that work in one browser but not in another browser.
This is a good place to get started with reproducing bugs, analyze why it happens, doing site outreach and filing browser bugs. https://webcompat.com/contributors/reproduce-bug

Start a Community Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re interested in facilitation and consensus building without the overhead of editing a specification, starting a CG is a great way to go.
Anyone can start a community group at the W3C.
Community groups are great places to flesh out a technology area and it’s intersection with the web.
Community groups can be used in many different ways.
One very effective way to work is to start a CG, and as the CG Chair invite people from outside the W3C in the domain of the CG to give feedback on their pain points for the web.
Then take those pain points, synthesize them into use cases and bring them to existing working groups to include in their existing standardization workflows.
In 2011, the games community group did just this, producing a set of use cases and bringing them to various working groups to be addressed.
Around 8 years later nearly all of the game developer pain points for the web have been addressed.
